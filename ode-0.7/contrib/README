This directory contains ODE-related things that have been generously
contributed by ODE's users. Why is this stuff here and not integrated
into the main ODE source tree?  There may be several reasons:

  * The author(s) and ODE maintainers(s) may not have had time to do
    the job.

  * It may not be finished.

  * It may contribute functionality that is useful but not considered
    to be part of ODE's core.

No guarantees are made about the code in this directory - it may not
be documented, it may not have been tested, and it may not even
compile for you.

Each package has its own subdirectory, with a README file in that
directory explaining what the package is.
